         IMPORTANT: TO SEE GETTERS/SETTERS YOU MUST CALL THEM USING "system.out.print(getter()/setter())"

         You can play with the setters by using the following methods:

        1. em1.setAlternateEmail();
        2. em1.changePassword();
        3. em1.setMailboxCapacity();

        You can play with the getters by using the following methods:

        1. em1.getAlternateEmail();
        2. em1.getPassword();
        3. em1.getMailboxCapacity();
         */




       /* System Objectives: (I wrote this out prior to assembling the app)
    1. Generate an email based off the same firstname.lastname@deparment.company.com
    2. Generate a random String for the password
    3. Have set methods to change the password, establish mailbox capacity, and define an
    alternate email address by employee ID.
    4. Establish get methods to display the name, email, and mailbox capacity after construction.  */
